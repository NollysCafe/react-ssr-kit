# react-ssr-kit

⚡ The perfect React SSR starter — ultra-light, ultra-modern, and built for developers who want control without compromise.

## 🧠 What is this?

`react-ssr-kit` is a zero-bloat, high-performance React framework for **server-side rendering**, with support for:

- ✅ React Router DOM (SSR-ready)
- ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- ✅ Cookie/session auth or JWT
- ✅ CORS + Security Headers
- ✅ DSL-style configuration
- ✅ Dev-time live reload (Vite)
- ✅ Full-stack TypeScript
- ✅ Express backend
- ✅ Modular folder structure (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `shared/`)
- ✅ SCSS styling, React-first design

No CRA, no magic, no "why is this broken" moments.

## 🚀 Why use this?

Because you want:
- A **full SSR** React app that works like React
- Developer-first ergonomics with modern tech
- Total control: every behavior is **configurable**
- An open, modular monorepo ready for scaling
